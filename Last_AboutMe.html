            <p>My name is Mason Valentine, and I'm an 11th grader at Dublin High School. I'm currently taking classes such as AP CSA, AP US History, AP Calculus BC, AP Language and Composition, and AP Biology.</p>
            <p>My interests include swimming, watching basketball, and eating. I swim every day, and I enjoy anything related to swimming. Swimming is my main passion, and I usually either swim the freestyle or butterfly.</p>
            <p>During my free time, I also enjoy watching TV shows such as South Park, The Office, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Naruto. I also run on a daily basis, in order to get lots of exercise. I also like to code in Python, and I've created several different Pygame applications with my code.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing many engineering-related goals. During the summer of 2020, I've taken an engineering course that allowed me to build a video game simulator out of a Raspberry Pi. In addition to this, I take weekly Python coding classes. I have also learned Java throughout my time in CSA. In the summer of 2022, I'm looking to create a startup that implements code in aspects such as the website. I hope to use some of the Java-related skills that I learned throughou the school year.</p>
            <p>In the future, I'm looking to pursue a career in business, but will also include some computer programming. I hope to have knowledge in both disciplines in order to have optimal business opportunities in the future.</p>
