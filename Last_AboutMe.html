            <p>My name is Mason Valentine, and I'm a 9th grader at Dublin High School. I'm currently taking classes, which include PreCalculus, Advanced English, and Honors Chemistry.</p>
            <p>My interests include swimming, basketball, football, video games, dogs, and eating. I enjoy eating good food on a daily basis, with my favorites being pizza, burgers, filet mignon, fried chicken, and teriyaki. However, since swimming is my passion and main sport, I can't eat too much of these things.</p>
            <p>I love sports, and I watch football and basketball a lot. I support the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
            <p>I'm a hard worker when I'm into a certain activity, such as sports or math. I enjoy reading classic novels such as Animal Farm, 1984, and Catcher in the Rye.</p>
