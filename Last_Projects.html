            <h5>MIT App Inventor - Quiz Me</h5>
            <h6>Project made with Goutham Rajagopal</h6>
            <p>This app started because I wanted to make a fun little game where someone could test their knowledge of random things in this world. It started as somewhat as a joke, with the app asking goofy questions. However, we later on added a timer and sections based on difficulty. The QuizMe app also included images for visual interaction.</p>

            <h5>Scratch - Head Soccer</h5>
            <h6>Project made with Shreyas Tulsi</h6>
            <p>Me and Shreyas started with a brainstorm, and we turned one of the brainstorms into a game. In this game, the objective is for the player to knock the soccer ball into the goal. To add a humorous twist, we used pictures of our own heads for the players. We also added a CPU, which could track the player in order to attempt to block the ball. If the CPU blocked enough balls, then the game ends. If you score certain amounts of goals, then the game levels up and the CPU reacts quicker. After beating all the levels, the player wins.</p>
